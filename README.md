The Fall by Albert Camus,Justin O'Brien Book Review

Name: Edward Day
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: extraordinary intelligence
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 27, 2022
Review: This author has received so many accolades over the years that there's really no need for me to add to them.
Camus will really make you think and get new insights into your own motivations. One especially for me is the attraction of the harshness of the Republican Party. It was more than a little embarrassing. At the end he makes the observation that if you admit your failings completely up front with people it tends to disarm them when they try to get condemning. This is certainly worth reading and savoring his perceptive intelligence.

Title: Not a big fan of the style here
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 15, 2021
Review: ‚ÄúI know what you‚Äôre thinking; it‚Äôs very hard to disentangle the true from the false in what I am saying. I admit you are right.‚Äù

In Albert Camus‚Äô The Fall, an expatriate Frenchman indulges us through a narration that gives us glimpses of his past, a journey that includes his experiences of being a lawyer as well as philosophical points about his life experiences. There is a sense that he omits quite a bit from his narration, and Camus‚Äô style creates this.

While I realize that this book is highly regarded in literary circles, I felt like this reading experience was only so-so.

I know mostly it was the author‚Äôs intentions, but the rambling, stream of consciousness quality to the story left me feeling rather detached from the narrator‚Äôs tale, and thus uninterested. There is a scatterbrained sort of effect where he begins, stalls, starts a subject, diverts, leaves the subject, and then goes onto something else. It is very jarring and difficult to latch onto what he is reporting to us. I have read novels where stream of consciousness is handled in a more capable way by the author; this is not the case here at all. Everything sort of falls flat because there is too much of a separation and disconnect between the reader and his story, resulting in his audience being indifferent to what he is saying.

And this brings me to the next point: the rather unremarkable narrator, who is speaking to us for the entirety. He reveals bits and fragments of his life experiences in a part boast, part confessional, duplicitous, self-indulgent, sort of way, but the fact that he is not putting all his cards on the table makes it difficult to care one way or another.

Admittedly, this is my first read of Camus, so I am not familiar with his style. I bought The Stranger a few years ago and have it on my to read pile, but I might put it on hold for a bit.

Title: Brilliant, but should be read closely
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on June 8, 2022
Review: Everyone is guilty, despite the fact that there is no law and no crime. In this, The Fall resembles Kafka's The Trial. It is brilliantly written, with a wonderful style. However, it is so dense with ideas and sly metaphors, it needs to be read closely, engaging intimately with his prose. My copy is thoroughly marked up.

Title: Insightful but ultimately indicative of an empty philosophy
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on June 4, 2012
Review: It is hard to classify this book -- it is referred to as a novel (or even a novella), but in many ways, it better serves as a philosophical discourse.

The book starts in a seedy bar, where a former lawyer is speaking with a visitor to the bar (the visitor is referred to as "you," as if the reader is in fact the visitor). The narrator explains, over the course of a few days, how his perspective on life fundamentally shifted. While the narrator once was eager to give to charities and help others, he has since chosen to cease this lifestyle in favor of debauchery and self-fulfillment. He explains that the only real reason that he was doing noble things such as helping others was the attention and praise that he received from it.

Camus is a very good writer, and the book moves at a quick, readable pace. Stylistically, it is very reminiscent of Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground. This was perhaps intentional -- Camus was a noted admirer of Dostoevsky, and Notes from Underground is often attributed as the start of the Existentialism movement of which Camus was a key part.

Camus also makes some very apt criticisms of human tendencies. Of particular note is the narrator's discussion of the change in attitudes and treatment of the recent dead. The observation that the dead are placed on a pedestal is perhaps not entirely unique, but Camus's discussion of why they are placed on a pedestal is reticent.

Ultimately, however, Camus's philosophy (or at least the philosophy of the narrator) is empty. The narrator's shift from doing good to doing nothing is never expressly critiqued, and indeed seems supported by the Existentialist approach of self-satisfaction. From a philosophical perspective (or even from a mere human perspective), this seems hollow and unsatisfying. After all, while the narrator was acting to help others (even for his own selfish tendencies), at least some ascertainable good was created.

So, while The Fall acts as a gateway to discussion and intellectual inquiry, it also provides a discouraging non-answer to the questions it raises regarding the worth of humanity.

Title: It was very different and that's what made it good
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on May 16, 2022
Review: This book was a great pleasure to read. Though I do have to say it was very different from camus writing. But for me this is what made it a nice read. It was a big brain thinker. You didn't agree hole heartily with the main character but understood his reasoning. Even reading it again I'm learning something new.
